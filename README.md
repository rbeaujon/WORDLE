# WORDLE

This is a game created from scratch by me.
It's based and inspired by the popular game Wordle. 

The original game was created and developed by Welsh software engineer Josh Wardle, and owned and published by The New York Times.

In the game, you need to find one word with five letters in length in six attempts.
The game shows the color according to your guess, green for hitting correctly a letter and orange for hitting one letter but in the incorrect position.

## Let's go to play
Guess the WORDLE in six tries.

Each guess must be a valid five-letter word. Hit the enter button to register your attempts.

After each guess, the color of the tiles will change to show how close your guess was to the word.

### Good luck!
