# WORDLE
Wordle is a web-based word game created and developed by Welsh software engineer Josh Wardle, and owned and published by The New York Times

In the game, you need to find one word with five letters in length in six attempts.
The game shows the color according to your guess, green for hitting correctly a letter and orange for hitting one letter but in the incorrect position.

## Let's go to play
Guess the WORDLE in six tries.

Each guess must be a valid five-letter word. Hit the enter button to register your attempts.

After each guess, the color of the tiles will change to show how close your guess was to the word.
